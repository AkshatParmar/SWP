# Project Description:
Restaurants are complicated systems with many moving parts that can be  optimized in many different ways, but it can be hard to identify the  improvement of the area due to its complexity. Utilizing easy to use  interfaces and computers to maintain a log of orders, tables, and other  collected data, *â€‹IdealMeal* will be able to identify the areas of  improvement without having a manager to keep track of every employee  themselves. Additionally, each employee will have access to the portal to  have an easier way to keep track of their orders and other tasks.
